What is a model? 
* informative summar of data
* framework for inferring associations
* a framework for predicting future observations
* may take many different functional forms
* a conceptualisation of the experiment

Predictive versus explanatory models. 

Predictive: you give data, it produces a prediction. 
Explanatory: identify factors that influence outcome.

Ideally both.

Two components of model: some kind of function or form, plus variation around the pattern. 

**Always begin with a research question**

Have to have some experimental factors of interest. 

To compare the mean response of an organism / system to a set of different experimental conditions
* obtain estimate of Treatement effect (mean difference)
* Is this Treatment effect different in subgroups of interest?
* What are hte most important factors influencing the mean response
* Subsidiary question: how can we design our experiemnt in future to more efficiently estimate the Treatment effects?

Through intentional design, can also measure 'unwanted' effects

1. Compare mean wheat yield between standard commerical and new variety.
Outcome measure: Tonnes/hectare
Experimental factor: Variety (new/standard)
Data 6 plots/variety

From our data we can calculate:

Observed overall mean wheat yield
Observed mean yield in STANDARD
Observed mean yield in NEW VARIETY

**insert algebra for (XhatA - Xhat)2 + (XhatB-Xhat)2**


Variation around each mean. 
## Repositories on GitHub

Our lessons are stored in Git repositories (or "repos") on GitHub.
We use the term *fork* to mean
"a copy of a GitHub-hosted repo that is also hosted on GitHub"
and the term *clone* to mean
"a copy of a GitHub-hosted repo that's located on someone else's machine".
In both cases,
the duplicate has a reference that points to the original repo.

In an ideal world,
we would put all of the common files used by our lessons
(such as the CSS style files and the image files with project logos)
in a template repo.
The master copy of each lesson would be a fork of that repo,
and each author's working copy would be a fork of that master:

![Forking Repositories]({{ page.root }}/fig/forking.svg)

However, GitHub only allows a user to have one fork of any particular repo.
This creates a problem for us because an author may be involved in writing several lessons,
each with its own repo.
We therefore use [GitHub Importer][github-importer] to create new lessons.
After the lesson has been created,
we manually add the [template repository]({{ site.template_repo }}) as a remote called `template`
to update the lesson when the template changes.

## GitHub Pages

If a repository has a branch called `gh-pages` (short for "GitHub Pages"),
GitHub publishes its content to create a website for the repository.
If the repository's URL is `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY`,
the website is `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY`.

GitHub Pages sites can include static HTML pages,
which are published as-is,
or they can use [Jekyll][jekyll] as described below
to compile HTML and/or Markdown pages with embedded directives
to create the pages for display.

> ## Why Doesn't My Site Appear?
>
> If the root directory of a repository contains a file called `.nojekyll`,
> GitHub will *not* generate a website for that repository's `gh-pages` branch.
{: .callout}

We write lessons in Markdown because it's simple to learn
and isn't tied to any specific language.
(The ReStructured Text format popular in the Python world,
for example,
is a complete unknown to R programmers.)
If authors want to write lessons in something else,
such as [R Markdown][r-markdown],
they must generate HTML or Markdown that [Jekyll][jekyll] can process
and commit that to the repository.
A [later episode]({{ page.root }}/04-formatting/) describes the Markdown we use.

> We do *not* prescribe what tools instructors should use when actually teaching:
> the [Jupyter Notebook][jupyter],
> [RStudio][rstudio],
> and the good ol' command line are equally welcome up on stage.
> All we specify is the format of the lesson notes.

## Jekyll

GitHub uses [Jekyll][jekyll] to turn Markdown into HTML.
It looks for text files that begin with a header formatted like this:

~~~
---
variable: value
other_variable: other_value
---
...stuff in the page...
~~~
{: .source}

and inserts the values of those variables into the page when formatting it.
The three dashes that start the header *must* be the first three characters in the file:
even a single space before them will make [Jekyll][jekyll] ignore the file.

The header's content must be formatted as [YAML][yaml],
and may contain Booleans, numbers, character strings, lists, and dictionaries of name/value pairs.
Values from the header are referred to in the page as `page.variable`.
For example,
this page:

~~~
---
name: Science
---
{% raw %}Today we are going to study {{page.name}}.{% endraw %}
~~~
{: .source}

is translated into:

~~~
<html>
  <body>
    <p>Today we are going to study Science.</p>
  </body>
</html>
~~~
{: .html}

> ## Back in the Day...
>
> The previous version of our template did not rely on Jekyll,
> but instead required authors to build HTML on their desktops
> and commit that to the lesson repository's `gh-pages` branch.
> This allowed us to use whatever mix of tools we wanted for creating HTML (e.g., [Pandoc][pandoc]),
> but complicated the common case for the sake of uncommon cases,
> and didn't model the workflow we want learners to use.
{: .callout}

## Configuration

[Jekyll][jekyll] also reads values from a configuration file called `_config.yml`,
which are referred to in pages as `site.variable`.
The [lesson template]({{ site.template_repo }}) does *not* include `_config.yml`,
since each lesson will change some of its value,
which would result in merge collisions each time the lesson was updated from the template.
Instead,
the [template]({{ site.template_repo }}) contains a script called `bin/lesson_initialize.py`
which should be run *once* to create an initial `_config.yml` file
(and a few other files as well).
The author should then edit the values in the top half of the file.

## Collections

If several Markdown files are stored in a directory whose name begins with an underscore,
[Jekyll][jekyll] creates a [collection][jekyll-collection] for them.
We rely on this for both lesson episodes (stored in `_episodes`)
and extra files (stored in `_extras`).
For example,
putting the extra files in `_extras` allows us to populate the "Extras" menu pulldown automatically.
To clarify what will appear where,
we store files that appear directly in the navigation bar
in the root directory of the lesson.
[The next episode]({{ page.root }}/03-organization/) describes these files.
