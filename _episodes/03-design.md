- "Explain overall organization of lesson files."
keypoints:
- "Auxiliary files are stored in the _layouts, _includes, and assets directories."
- "The code of conduct, license, Makefile, and contribution guidelines should not be modified."
- "The README, authors' list, and citation instructions must be updated for each lesson."

## Controls
1. Direct comparison with a known standard or no treatment
2. Tested under identical conditions to experimental treatment

## Replication

Repeating experiments on different samples to:
  1. increase precision of treatment effect
  2. Make result more generalisable
  
Needs to be done in different contexts. 

## Blocking
Grouping together of similar experimental units. 
1. If we apply treatments to something that is the most similar background.

## Randomisation: 
Probabilistic process of making treatment assignments. Consider also randomising order of testing. 

## Blinding
Masking of treatment assignment. Blinding includes:
* Allocation blinded
* Evaluator blinded

## Experimental design challenge. As exercise. 

How is seedling emergence (in Banksia) influenced by temperature and moisture? 
Setup: 12 shelters, 2 garden beds per shelter, 24 pots per bed.
E

What is the response? (what exactly will you measure?)
What are the factors?
How will you arrange your pots?
