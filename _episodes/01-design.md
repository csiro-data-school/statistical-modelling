Statistics in biology is the study of biological variation. Statical ideas about biological variation inform the design of experiments. What are the sources of variation? Statistical thinking is an essential componet of scientific thinking. 

What are the sources of variantion? E.g. experiment on temperature ... humidity, environmental conditions, technician, instrument, chemicals or reagents, biological variation. 
What can we influence? WHich plants get which treatement. Begin by thinking about what are the potential sources of variation. E.g. position on field. Then think about how to design experiments to separate 

E.g. tomato plant. Have mutant that is drought resistant. Put mutant on bottom, wild type on top shelf. Enough samples to account for variation. BUt, fundamental mistake. Shelf is a source of variation. Can't separate the genotype effect from the shelf effect. Solution: randomise the location of the plants. Take home message: statistical ideas begin when we design the experiment, not when we get the data. 

We need to incorporate the design of the experiment in our analysis. 
Statistics is a framework, bones of scientific thinking over top of which you can apply your domain knowledge. Bring your data to dress the skeleton.
